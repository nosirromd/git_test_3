PROJECT: PRACTICING GIT BASICS

Introduction
This short project will demonstrate how to use Git to manage and track your project folders.

You will set up a remote repository on GitHub and then copy it onto your local machine.

Once this repo is set up locally, you will be able to use Git like a save button for your files and folders.

When you have finalized your saves, you can then push your local repo up onto GitHub to share with everyone!
